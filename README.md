# Idea: Statistical Analysis of Hospital Data using MPC
  
  ##### Current Situation:

  A lot of hospitals are computing with each other in order to be better than others. But for that the main thing is analysis, And for analysis data is most important part. When its competition the data should be private and hospital data needs to be secure because it contains sensitive information about patients. 
    Thus we are thinking of developing a solution where multiple hospitals can share their data without comprimising on the privacy for the analysis like which hospital is going to attract more patients in the upcpming year.

  ##### Proposed Methodology
  
   For secure sharing of data we will use Multi Party Computing 
   
   For predictive analysis we will use Linear Regression.
