Description: The Virtual Ideal Functionality Framework is a framework for doing
        secure multi-party computations (SMPC). Features include:
        
        * secret sharing based on standard Shamir and pseudo-random secret
        sharing (PRSS).
        
        * arithmetic with shares from Zp or GF(2^8): addition, multiplication,
        exclusive-or.
        
        * two comparison protocols which compare secret shared Zp inputs, with
        secret GF(2^8) or Zp output.
        
        * reliable Bracha broadcast secure against active adversaries.
        
        * computations with any number of players for which an honest majority
        can be found.
        
        All operations are automatically scheduled to run in parallel meaning
        that an operation starts as soon as the operands are ready.
